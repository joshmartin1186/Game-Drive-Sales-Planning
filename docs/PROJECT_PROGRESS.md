# GameDrive Project Progress Tracker

## Project Overview
- **Client:** Game Drive (Utrecht, Netherlands)
- **Project:** Sales Planning Tool MVP
- **Budget:** $5,000 fixed price
- **Start Date:** December 23, 2024
- **Target Completion:** January 22, 2025
- **Live URL:** https://gamedrivesalesplanning.vercel.app/

## Quick Reference for New Sessions

### Repository & Deployment
- **GitHub:** joshmartin1186/Game-Drive-Sales-Planning (main branch)
- **Vercel Team ID:** team_6piiLSU3y16pH8Kt0uAlDFUu
- **Vercel Project ID:** prj_G1cbQAX5nL5VDKO37D73HnHNHnnR
- **Production URL:** https://gamedrivesalesplanning.vercel.app
- **Supabase Project ID:** znueqcmlqfdhetnierno (eu-west-1)

### ⚠️ Critical Technical Notes
- **CSS Framework:** CSS Modules (NOT Tailwind) - Tailwind had silent compilation failures on Vercel
- **Row Heights:** MUST use fixed `height` (not `min-height`) for timeline positioning calculations
  - `.productRow`: `height: 40px`
  - `.platformRow`: `height: 36px`
- **Deployment:** GitHub commits auto-deploy to Vercel within 2-3 minutes
- **Testing:** Always request screenshot verification after UI changes - deployment success doesn't guarantee visual correctness
- **GitHub API Encoding:** When updating files via GitHub API, be careful of HTML entity encoding - this has caused TypeScript build failures

### Key Files
- `app/page.tsx` - Main application component
- `app/page.module.css` - Main page styling
- `app/components/GanttChart.tsx` - Timeline component
- `app/components/GanttChart.module.css` - Timeline styling

## Issue Implementation Details

### Issue #1: PowerPoint Export Bug ✅
**Status:** Marked complete by client

---

### Issue #2: Timeline vs Sale Modal Date Mismatch ✅
**Problem:** Sales created via modal showed on wrong dates on timeline (off by one day)

**Root Causes Found & Fixed:**
1. Midnight normalization - Date parsing was shifting dates due to timezone
2. Header alignment - 220px header padding wasn't applied to day headers
3. Emoji rendering - Unicode escapes not rendering as actual emojis

---

### Issue #3: "Today" Date Visibility ✅
**Problem:** Users couldn't easily navigate to current date on the timeline

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added "Today" button in scroll grab bar
- Red vertical indicator line showing current date position
- Today's date column highlighted in header (pink background)
- Scroll-to-today functionality centers current date in view

---

### Issue #4: Duration Input Flexibility ✅
**Problem:** 14-day max limit was too restrictive for some sales

**Solution Implemented:**
- Removed 14-day limit from AddSaleModal and EditSaleModal
- Users can now set any duration with hard Start/End dates
- Validation still checks platform-specific rules

---

### Issue #5: Resize Sales on Timeline ✅
**Problem:** Users wanted to drag sale edges to change duration without opening modal

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added resize handles on left/right edges of SaleBlock
- Drag to resize with real-time visual feedback
- Validation on resize completion
- Rollback if resize creates conflicts

---

### Issue #6: Auto-Generate Platform Selection ✅
**Problem:** Auto-generate created sales on ALL platforms, users wanted to choose

**Solution Implemented:**
- 2-step wizard in SaleCalendarPreviewModal
- Step 1: Select which platforms to include (checkboxes)
- Step 2: Choose strategy (Aggressive/Balanced/Conservative)
- Platforms with 0-day cooldown excluded by default
- Select All / Deselect All buttons

---

### Issue #7: Platform Color Editing ✅
**Problem:** Some platform colors were too similar, hard to distinguish

**Solution Implemented:**
- Enhanced color picker in PlatformSettings
- 16 preset color swatches for quick selection
- Hex text input for manual color entry
- Color similarity warning when chosen color is too close to another platform
- Visual comparison grid showing all platform colors

---

### Issue #8: Sales Gap Indicator ✅
**Problem:** Users need to see gaps in sales coverage per platform/quarter

**Solution Implemented:**
- GapAnalysis component with collapsible panel
- Analyzes gaps per product/platform/quarter
- Smart cooldown awareness: Excludes cooldown periods from "actionable gaps"
- Shows breakdown: X days sale / X days cooldown / X days available
- Gap percentage based on available opportunities
- Filters by platform, minimum gap days
- Sort by gap length, percentage, or quarter
- Critical gap highlighting (30+ days)

---

### Issue #9: Historical Sales Import ✅
**Problem:** Users need to bulk import historical sales from Excel

**Solution Implemented:**
- ImportSalesModal with 3-step wizard: Upload → Map Columns → Preview & Import
- Auto-detects column mappings from common header names
- Parses multiple date formats (ISO, US, EU, etc.)
- Validates products/platforms against existing database
- Shows errors/warnings per row with color coding
- Duplicate detection
- Preview table with validation indicators before import

---

### Issue #10: Version/Draft System ✅
**Problem:** Users need to save calendar snapshots and compare/restore versions

**Solution Implemented:**
- VersionManager component for calendar snapshots
- Save current calendar state as named version
- List all saved versions with metadata (date, sale count, date range)
- Preview version contents before restoring (platform breakdown)
- Restore version (replaces all current sales)
- Delete versions
- "Versions" button in main toolbar

---

### Issue #11: Duplicate Sale Feature ✅
**Problem:** Users need to quickly duplicate sales to new dates or platforms

**Solution Implemented:**
- DuplicateSaleModal component with two modes:
  - Duplicate to new date (with quick offset buttons: +1 week, +2 weeks, +1 month, +1 quarter)
  - Duplicate to multiple platforms at once
- Real-time validation for all duplicates
- Shows conflicts/cooldown violations per target
- Batch creation of valid duplicates only
- Duplicate button added to SaleBlock (timeline)
- Duplicate button added to SalesTable (list view)
- Duplicate button added to EditSaleModal

## Technical Learnings & Patterns

### CSS Best Practices for This Project
1. **Always use fixed `height` for timeline rows** - `min-height` breaks absolute positioning
2. **CSS Modules only** - Tailwind had silent compilation failures on Vercel
3. **Test visually after every CSS change** - Build success ≠ visual correctness

### GitHub API Pitfalls
1. **HTML Entity Encoding:** When uploading TypeScript files via GitHub API, ensure content doesn't get HTML-encoded
2. **Always verify deployment success** after file updates - check Vercel build logs

### Debugging Patterns That Work
1. Compare deployment timestamps with commit history to identify breaking changes
2. Use systematic console logging at strategic points
3. Check CSS property diffs when layout breaks
4. Capture callbacks and data at event start (mousedown) rather than relying on refs

### Deployment Workflow
1. Make changes via GitHub MCP
2. Commit with descriptive message
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel auto-deploy
4. Request screenshot verification
5. Use direct deployment URLs to bypass edge cache
