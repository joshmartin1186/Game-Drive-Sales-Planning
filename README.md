## Key Technical Decisions

1. **CSS Modules over Tailwind**: Tailwind had silent compilation failures on Vercel
2. **Optimistic UI**: All operations update instantly, rollback on error
3. **TypeScript Strict**: Catches errors at compile time
4. **Screenshot Verification**: Deployment success ≠ visual correctness
